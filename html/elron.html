        <h1>Neverwinter Jail</h1>
        <h2>Think carefully</h2>

      <div class="story-text">
        <p id="part-1" class="fadeInAnimated">You sit in the prison waiting for you inevitable punishment. The night before you were in the village. The small village of Oakhurst.</p>
        <p id="part-2" class="fadeInAnimated">You were tired and you spent your gold for a room at the inn. It was normal then, but as you lay for the night the whispers began. Your god telling you `They are changing, everything is changing and you are the only one that can stop it`. As you arose and left your room. The horrors began.</p>
        <p id="part-3" class="fadeInAnimated">They weren't the same, you swear to yourself. It's not your mind you plead with yourself, they had changed. Had become twisted horrible versions of themselves. You had no choice but to destroy them and bring light back to this place.</p>
        <p id="part-4" class="fadeInAnimated">As the village burned, a detachment of The Neverwinter Guard, were patrolling the area and found you. It was clear to them that you were responsible but they would not listen to reason. They beat you. Carried you away. </p>
        <p id="part-5" class="fadeInAnimated">Now you sit and wait but the whispers start again. `They are changing again. Only you can stop it` You hear a commotion outside your cell. Around you your cell starts to transform. The bricks and the bars warp and change before your very eyes and you can see outside. Your cell is now open.</p>
        <p id="part-6" class="fadeInAnimated">You hear <span id='elron-secret'>screaming.</span> The guard that was posted to the jail that evening is being attacked by a horror similar to the ones that you have seen before.....</p>
