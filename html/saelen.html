        <p id="part-1" class="fadeInAnimated">You lie in the room you have hired for the evening, awaiting sleep to take you. Beforehand you prepared some of your evening rituals. Not the normal kind of druid rituals but ones that appeal more to your lifestyle. You prepare tea`s and remedies that sooth both body and mind after a day of rigorous physical activity and entertaining the masses. Ones that you sell to make a bit of gold. Other druids might consider this against tradition but what`s the harm to make your way in life. You have a fighters heart.</p>
        <p id="part-2" class="fadeInAnimated">As sleep just about takes you, you hear an urgent knocking on your door. You hear Yalrut, the bard `Saelen! There seems to be something going on outside. Come have a look.` You peer out the window and see the other patrons and a few others standing together. Somewhat irked that sleep has been interrupted, you quickly don your gear and head outside. </p>
        <p id="part-3" class="fadeInAnimated">Immedietly as you leave the front of the inn, you noticed a change this evening. The night sky now has an omninous purple hue pulsating. It's unlike anything you have seen before. You stand near the other patrons in almost silence <span id="saelen-secret">watching</span> this unfold. When suddenly....</p>
        <p id="part-4" class="fadeInAnimated">A sharp fork of red lightning blasts down and strikes the ground nearby. After the first more violent bolts strike the ground all around and people begin to panic. In the darkness you notice that where the lightning has struck, shapes are beginning to form. One of the closer shapes starts moving in the direction of the inn. A monster! You ready your weapon.</p>
        <p id="part-5" class="fadeInAnimated">The patrons begin running in all directions in a mass panic. The monster appears looking for prey, but you are here, you are ready for a real fight and you attack. As you fight with this beast another huge bolt of red lightning hits the ground near you. The ground shakes violently and you see a rip in reality, a portal to somewhere? </p>
        <p id="part-6" class="fadeInAnimated">Distracted for only a moment you see the monster has grabbed one of the patrons and runs directly into the portal where you can see them on the otherside. This is it a real challenge. You are just about to follow when you hear Yalrut call out `Saelen! Stop! No what are you doing?!` You.......</p>
