        <p id="part-1" class="fadeInAnimated">You find yourself in Neverwinter Wood. You have heard many an unsettling rumour of this region. The trees and plants have started to warp unnaturally, peaceful animals are now aggresive. There was also a massacre at the small village of <span id="nyx-secret">Oakhurst</span> nearby. You continue on with your mission.....</p>
        <p id="part-2" class="fadeInAnimated">It's as you feared, the wood here has become decayed and sickly. As you investigate you cannot fathom how this has come to pass. You have never seen fauna grow such as this. It feels otherworldy, and you know it doesn't belong here.</p>
        <p id="part-3" class="fadeInAnimated">You spend time casting a healing ritual on the wood, you have done this many times before but to no avail. A very powerful magic is at work here. </p>
        <p id="part-4" class="fadeInAnimated">As you continue investigating you find a trail of footprints, as you continue to follow them you hear a shout nearby. What do you do?</p>
