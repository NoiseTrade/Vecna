      <div class="story-text">
        <p id="part-1" class="fadeInAnimated">You stalk the streets of Gloomwrought. Memory plays on your mind more these days, and have flashes of the old one. A cold mountain and the sword. A fiery landscape. Enemies and Friends. Death. Since you began this new life, you have never truly had rest and this life has felt much longer than the last. The more that you do for your patron, the harder it is to get out of this pact.</p>
        <p id="part-2" class="fadeInAnimated">You dutifully go to your next task. She has asked you to do things many times in her own way but you have never truly met her before. You know that she is there. She is always there.</p>
        <p id="part-3" class="fadeInAnimated">This time she has asked you to investigate a disturbance in Gloomwrought. Something is happening here and you can feel a sense of urgency in this task. You have been to Gloomwrought and the far reaches of the shadowfell many times over. You know these streets better than you would like. You go to the street where the old crone is always washing her clothes and as expected there she is. You approach and flash a shiny coin in her direction and ask `Crone, tell me what secrets you know.` She looks to you as she furiously scrubs the rags in a bucket of water `We can`t be dealing in secrets no more.... no more... The one that <span id="dolram-secret">whispers</span> is near and the ones who seek whispers will find you...` You notice she points a finger down the street towards an old graveyard. You flick the coin at her and she catches it quicker than you expect and make your way down the street. </p>
        <p id="part-4" class="fadeInAnimated">As you approach the graveyard you immedietly see that something is going on. A purple energy pulsating in the air. You rush towards the source. In the center of the graveyard near the biggest headstones you find it. You can see what looks like reality ripping itself apart, parts of the graveyard are being reshaped and molded into something else? At the front of this tear in reality you see a woman standing, donned in a black dress and a pointy hat struggling to containt the tear, all around her are robed figure motionless on the ground. She notices your arrival `Excuse me darling, your timing couldn't be any better. Whilst I try and stop this becoming unmanagable would you be so kind as to kill anyone that approaches? I would love that.` Just as she finishes speaking the words you notice more robed figures approach trying to reach the woman.</p>
        <p id="part-5" class="fadeInAnimated">You unsheathe the sword. You have done this a thousand times. It's like an extension of your body, but also an extension to her. With every swing of the blade, dispatching the robed figures you can feel her within it empowering you. You make quick work of your enemies, you notice one last robed figure reaching out to the woman. Within you, you summon her magic and fire an eldritch blast. It hits it`s target.</p>
        <p id="part-6" class="fadeInAnimated">You can see the woman struggling against the tear, her arms and legs are shaking then suddenly she falls to her knees. The tear remains open and starts to get bigger. The woman looks at you and says `Thank you for the assistance dear, but it seems this might have been for nothing. I think it`s best that you get out of here and by here I mean this reality.` She shakily gets on her feet and with her last bit of strength she casts a spell, opening a portal. `Ta, ta!` she says and steps through. There is a moment the portal remains open. The thoughts appear. You could walk through?</p>
