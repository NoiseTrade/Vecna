        <h2>The impossible choice</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="story-text">
        <p id="part-1" class="fadeInAnimated">Another sleepy evening in the community that you have built here with Torsten and your father. You stand on the coast near the house you have built. Waves crash on the rocks below as you look out to see. It`s peaceful. Recently a purple hue has lingered in the sky <span id="nyla-secret">shimmering</span> and you spent the evenings just watching this before bed.</p>
        <p id="part-2" class="fadeInAnimated">You settled on Gundarlun after the events on the island. After the moss and the black obelisks. Your father insisted that this place was a place of power and importance to Talos. To you, it was finally a place to settle. You are getting comfortable with this way of life. Recently some strangers sailed here. They are a research group from Neverwinter. Their leader Sarcelle Malinosh is a sorcerer, nice enough. You are being a decent host and letting them stay nearby. You barely see them as they go further inland to do their research. You just hope that it won't interfere with you and the community. </p>
        <p id="part-3" class="fadeInAnimated">As you are looking out to sea, you hear shouts coming from the village. You rush over to find one of the research assitants a little bloodied and bruised, shouting for help. `Sarcelle and the others they are in trouble! Please! they need help. They found something!` Others from the village appear. Torsten and your father too. They take him to the communal hall in the village to rest and patch up. You look at the others a little hesitant. Torsten looks at you `We have got to help them. What choice do we have?` Your father pipes up `They found something! It must be to do with the great Talos. I am coming too.` You rush to your home and don your gear.</p>
        <p id="part-4" class="fadeInAnimated">You trek inland and climb part way up a mountain. The research assistant leads you to the mouth of a cave. `We were in here when things started going crazy.` You look above you. The purple shimmering in the sky feels more like an omen now. Without even thinking your father forges ahead of you. You and Torsten follow.</p>
        <p id="part-5" class="fadeInAnimated">As you enter the cave at first it is dark and you light a torch. The deeper you go in magical purple light can be seen within. You sneak in. You come into an open cavern and within you notice robed figures preparing a ritual. You can see the research group tied up, the robed figures leaning over them knives at the ready. Without enough time to prepare your father once again charges ahead shouting `You besmirch a sacred place of Talos` firing a lightning bolt as he goes. Torsten heroically runs in after him. You have no choice but to do the same.</p>
        <p id="part-6" class="fadeInAnimated">The robed figures act quickly and kill one of the research group. This seems to finish their ritual and portals begin opening in the cave walls. You fight the robed figures with well practiced magic but there is more of them than you can handle. They begin grabbing the research group and dragging them into the various portals. They overwhelm your father and also Torsten. You don't have enough time to react..... You need to choose.</p>
